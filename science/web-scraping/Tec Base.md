2. HTML Structure

3. REST, SOUP API

4. AJAX

   Sometimes, fetching content from dynamic sites is actually straightforward, as they are highly dependent on API calls. In asynchronous loading, most of the time, data is loaded by making GET and POST requests; you can watch these API calls in the Network tab of Developer Tools.

   In the network tab, you will get all the information regarding the request URL, required params, and **header information**.

   Make sure that you provide the **headers** and other required information accurately. If you don't provide the headers and additional information correctly, then it is possible that you might get an HTTP status code of 401, 403(**forbbiden**), etc. instead of a 200 response from the server

6. Captcha

   Captcha is a type of challenge-response test used in computing to determine whether or not the user is human, and it is quite popular these days for keeping spammers away.

   When captchas are present on the page where you want to scrape the data, the basic setup of scraping will inevitably fail because itn cannot pass the barrier of captchas.
