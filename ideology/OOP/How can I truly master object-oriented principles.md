# How can I truly master object-oriented principles?

Ashkan Khanzadeh Nazary

My own personal experience is this:

1. Stop that ! Do not even consider trying to *think* in OOP about anything including your code, specially your code !!
2. Learn TDD. Read the excellent Kent Beck book on the subject
3. Learn to refactor. Read the excellent Martin Fowler book on the subject
4. Following  the TDD principles, just code in anyway you can and then immediately   refactor (this is where the magic happens). You will being to truly   understand and appreciate some of the lesser, less abstract OOP stuff.   Periodically come back to your code and see if you can even refactor it  further. You will then being to re-discover some other higher level OOP  stuff.
5. After your feel ready for  more expansion (you would know if you follow these steps), learn some  design patterns. There are plenty of tutorials for  any language on the  Internet on that. You can also try the de facto  book from Gang of Four.  Try to apply your knowledge of patterns into  your refactorings (i.e. try  to refactor your code towards patterns).  This is where you begin to  realize what OOP has to say regarding design and even some architecture.
6. Read  the book "Refactoring to Patterns" from Joshua Kerivsky. Get back to   your code and try to employ the new insights in your refactorings. This  is where some missing links are formed and in the end you would have a  pretty firm understanding of OOP from both a practical and a  theoretical  view.
7. Only after following all  the above you can truly comprehend the  philosophical underlying ideas of  OOP (which are not in the least  important or required to enjoy the  benefits of OOP in the fullest). 

If your passion for OOP still holds, then try:

1. Read Martin Fowler's blog
2. Read  the wikipedia articles for general software engineering principles.   Start with the Separation of Concerns then follow the links. Soon you   will be floating in an ocean of ideas and principles. Try to link them   to your refactotrings.
3. Learn yourself a Haskel for Good. The sheer contrast would make you understand OOP even better.
4. Learn yourself some type theory. Learn Scala. Read Martin Odersky's articles about the language.

If you did all that, definitely send me your resume ;-)
