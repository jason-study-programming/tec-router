## Stand Stone

If you are new to frontend web development, I strongly recommend you to follow and read through this awesome tutorial provided by MDN(Resources for Developers, by Developers) [MDN - Learn web development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn). It's a well-designed tutorial, which provides you a progressive introduction to specific web tec and set up a robust and overall perception of web development.



## Necessary Experience

After completing the MDN tutorial you must practice in some real projects just with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript until you are comfortable with them(CSS Selector, Flex, Form, ES6 import, Class Syntax,  Event, AJAX, Promise, Fetch,  async/await). **Remember that you should not learn any framework at this stage.** Trust me, this is the most efficient learning route. If you are not well familiar with these basics or lack enough practice experience, you can neither understand framework advantages nor master it. In that condition, you will lose in an endless learning circle.



## Modern Frontend Development Environment

Before libraries and frameworks, you need to learn Node.js and Bundler. 

Most JavaScript packages are published with npm(**Node** Package Manager). [Nodejs in action](..\books\Frontend\Nodejs in action (2th Edithon), Alex R. Young, Bradley Meck, Mike Cantelon, Tim Oxley, s (2017).pdf) is a good choice to learn Node.js.

You need a bundler to take all your files and packages, and turn them into a neat package that you will be able to run in the browser. There are several bundler choices. But, personally, I recommend you [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/), which is the most powerful but needs and deserves more effort to grasp. 

[JavaScript Tutorial â€“ How to Set Up a Front End Development Project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-set-up-a-front-end-development-project/) gives you a detailed explanation about them. 

 

## Utilize Powerful Framework

Well, congratulations, It's time to choose a frontend framework(React, Vue, Angular). You should take it by yourself, because 'Which framework is the best one to choose?' is an endless topic. Each one is OK.

Personally, I choose [React](https://reactjs.org/), developed and refined by Facebook's successful commercial practice, which provides you a framework ability of efficiency and quality, meanwhile, keeps you enjoying flexibility from pure JavaScript. It's determined by yourself how much to use React in your project.
