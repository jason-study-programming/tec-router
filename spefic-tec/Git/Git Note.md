## merge

scenario1: 

merge local-feature-branch to local-master-branch

push repo



scenario2:

pull from current repo

merge recent-local-master-branch to local-feature-branch

push local-feature-branch to repo

merge repo-feature-branch to repo-master-branch



You can get the best of both worlds: rebase local changes before pushing to clean up your work, but never rebase anything that youâ€™ve pushed somewhere.



## Frequently used Command

```cmd
# create a new branch
git branch <new-branch-name>

# To delete a local branch in Git, you simply run:
git branch -d <branch-name>
```
